            Gamers. I know why you're here. You're alone, you're scared, you're bad at games... No I'm just joking, you're here because I brought you here, maybe not physically or actually telling
            you to go here, but you came here because you were interested. But talking about before, maybe you are feeling a bit alone, maybe you're not the best at games that you'd like to be.
            That affects all of us! I'd had countless times where I ask my friends to play and their busy, or they don't want to play the game I'm currently playing. And that sucks.
            So this is a reach out, to you. To all gamers far and wide to say, I'm here for you. I'll come and be by your side.</p>

            So, what's the jig? Well the name's Deano! I'm a 21 year old gamer. I'm from the UK, located in Manchester,
            <br>
            <br>
            The type of multiplayer games I mainly play are Apex, Valorant, Osu!, CS:GO, Valheim, Dragon Ball FighterZ, Soul Calibur VI, Skullgirls and Call of Duty.
            <br>
            <br>
            I stream sometimes, albeit not as much as I'd like to, I kinda got into streaming late.
            I have a YouTube too, once again still don't upload on it much either.</p>

                <p style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; position: relative; color: white; width: 90%; padding-left: 4%; margin-right: auto; padding-right: 8%; font-size: 1vw;">
                The reason as to why you should play with me, is because I want to play with you! I'm a chill, banterous, nerdy, pretty skilled gamer. You'll be able to get along with me on almost 
                every genre, FPS, RPG, Platformer, Fighters, Rhythm and Sandbox are the most common genres I play. Whether you want to play with me because your friends are busy at the time,
                or you just want a player with some skill and banter on your team. Or maybe you want carrying, in which case I'll go tryhard mode for you, take control of the team- give orders,
                really try and get you those wins. And I have dedication! Just look at how many hours I have in CS!</p>
